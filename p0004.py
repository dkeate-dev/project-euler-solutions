# Largest Palindrome Project

# A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of
# two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.
# Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.



# What's the best order? Find palindromes and factorize or check if multiples are palindromes
# Iterate from the top? 
# 999 x 999, 
# 999 x 998, 
# 998 x 998, 
# 999 x 997, 
# 998 x 997, ...
